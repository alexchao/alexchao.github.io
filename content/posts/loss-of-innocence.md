This year, I will turn 40. A phenomenon I've been struggling to reconcile as I approach this milestone is the reality that life continues to take its own twists and turns regardless of whether you're prepared for it to. We are always told to be skeptical of how our memory of events can skew their positive and negative affect, but I can't help but remember my experience as a twenty-something well into my mid-thirties as one of abounding optimism, as I bounced around the globe, chasing one stimulating opportunity to the next. This appetite for stimulation and exploration was a guiding force &mdash; both overtly and as an undercurrent &mdash;Â in my career choices, hobbies, and social interactions. I was at the center of my own world, and I defined myself according to the shape and depth of the inroads I made in each of these endeavors.

Facing this 40-year milestone, I now have authentically adult responsibilities on my plate, with a partner with whom to build a life and a new one not far off. Our current living situation and plans give us only a 6-month window of certainty about where we will live. My career is also in a state of suspension, with the industry itself undergoing a epochal reshaping at the will of LLM technology, and the problem of where I will fit in within it still for me to crack.

These are the sobering conditions of this transitional stage in my life, but what I also notice is the weight of the state of world pressing in on my outlook. There are two reasons for this, one external to me and the other internal.

## The world has become more chaotic

Or at least that's what it feels like. The present has a host of concerns on offer that 10 years ago would not have seemed plausible or, even if so, were only apparent to those who were paying close attention to the trends. To enumerate some of the things that have invaded extant reality:

- The invasion of Ukraine by Putin's Russia and the ongoing ground war.
- The looming threat of war between Taiwan and China.
- A massive flare-up in the conflicts in the Middle East, leading to major upheavals in regional power.
- A second Trump presidency, and generally, the rise of rulers with authoritarian leanings; the waning strength of liberal democracy.
- A truly transformative technological innovation in large language model AI.

There's far more to list here, like the global pandemic and its effect on society, identity politics, the Arab Spring, religious extremism in Western society, etc. but what I hope to document for myself is the scale of change that took place over these last 10 years.

- The world has become &mdash; as many seem to report &mdash; more chaotic.
- I have grown more attuned to 

Notes to finish:

- Certain: I have changed. I pay more attention, and understand things better.
- Probable, but less certain: The world got more chaotic.

Things:

- I live in Taiwan. The threat of war with China looms always, despite the disinterest of the Taiwanese people.
- War in Russia.
- War in the middle east.
- Trump's second term.
- Impending reformation of the Democratic party.
- Greatest technological breakthrough of our time.

The only thing I hope to capture in this post is the stark contrast from one phase of life to the next, compounded by the surrounding context, that would have not been a compounding factor if not for an inner, personal change.
