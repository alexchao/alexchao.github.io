Learning Chinese could be the one thing in my adult life that has effected the greatest influence on the path I took?

The first thing to say about what it takes to learn a new skill effectively is that it takes **hunger**. You could even say that this hunger to acquire new abilities is really all you need to achieve your learning goals, but that would be uninteresting. In fact, there is quite a bit to say about the phenomena that stem from this hunger: hunger-fueled learning hatches new knowledge-acquisition and muscle-strengthening behaviors, frequently borne of compulsive desperation, that do not manifest in typical learning pathways.

# The Grand Gesture

To study Chinese, I made the decision to leave my job and put my career on pause so that I could move to Taiwan and enroll in a formal, university-run language program. At the time, I was 30, with roughly 8 years of experience behind me as a software engineer. With a year and a half of formal study and some months bookending my time abroad to move and get settled, it would be a full two years before I would start working again.

I later came to understand that this hiatus was not without its costs, both to my career and my personal life. On the career side, being completely absent from the tech industry for two years amounted to [falling out of touch with the scene]. In my personal life, friendships waned as people with whom I regularly shared experiences were suddenly separated by an ocean and several timezones. They went on about their lives, as did I.

However, these costs were not entirely unforeseeable, and I had mentally flagged a few of them before I left for Taiwan.

All of this is to say that the decision I made about *how* to learn Chinese came with a significant investment in all areas of my life. This is conceptually similar to The Grand Gesture that Cal Newport writes about in *Deep Work*. My recollection of my mental state at that time is hazy, and the physical move to Asia afforded all sorts of logistical issues, but surely the uprooting of my life created space for a psychological commitment to the goal to take shape.

# True Immersion

A proper learning environment is one where you are forced to use your emerging skills without recourse to familiar crutches. To this end, Taiwan is a society where most people would prefer not to speak English if they can avoid it (as compared to other cosmpolitan hubs in Asia, like Hong Kong or Singapore), and choosing to live there was the obvious first step towards ensuring that my daily interactions involved utterances in Chinese.

However, it is not uncommon to encounter expats in Taiwan who have lived there for years and yet who can't complete a sentence in Chinese, as obvious evidence that physical presence is insufficient unless you engage with the society around you. Furthermore, the most fruitful contact points with local society require injecting yourself into pockets of the social fabric where non-native speakers are less likely to tread, but where a language-agnostic shared interest serves as a medium for facilitating communication across the language barrier. For me, these were the symphonic band and symphony orchestra at the university where I studied. The deep familiarity I possessed with music, music theory, and how rehearsals are typically run situated my mind in a context that was fitfully primed to infer the meaning of words and phrases I had never heard before.

# Spaced Repetition

# Some Social Friction

- Having to interrupt conversations all the time to make new flashcards
- A sort of repugnant realization: it may become evident to you and your interlocuter that your relationship exists purely or at least primarily for the benefit of your language advancement
- Insisting on Chinese, no matter what
- Avoiding social situations with lots of expats
