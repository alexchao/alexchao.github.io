Learning Chinese could be the one thing in my adult life that has effected the greatest influence on the path I took?

The first thing to say about what it takes to learn a new skill effectively is that it takes **hunger**. You could even say that this hunger to acquire new abilities is really all you need to achieve your learning goals, but that would be uninteresting. In fact, there is quite a bit to say about the phenomena that stem from this hunger: hunger-fueled learning hatches new knowledge-acquisition and muscle-strengthening behaviors, frequently borne of compulsive desperation, that do not manifest in typical learning pathways.

# The Grand Gesture

To study Chinese, I made the decision to leave my job and put my career on pause so that I could move to Taiwan and enroll in a formal, university-run language program (Taiwan National Normal University's Mandarin Training Program). At the time, I was 30, with roughly 8 years of experience as a software engineer behind me. With a year and a half of formal study and some months bookending my time abroad to move and get settled, it would be a full two years before I would start working again.

I later came to understand that this hiatus was not without its costs, both to my career and my personal life. On the career side, being completely absent from the tech industry for two years amounted to drifting away from the locus of engineering innovation. (There were of course ways to stay abreast of the industry trends, but that's perhaps just another consequence of following a deeply-seated personal goal: it is all-consuming.) In my personal life, friendships waned, as people with whom I regularly shared experiences were suddenly separated by an ocean and several timezones. They went on about their lives, as did I.

However, these costs were not entirely unforeseeable, and I had mentally flagged a few of them before I left for Taiwan.

All of this is to say that the decision I made about *how* to learn Chinese came with a significant investment in all areas of my life. This is conceptually similar to The Grand Gesture that Cal Newport writes about in *Deep Work*. My recollection of my mental state at that time is hazy, and the physical move to Asia presented all sorts of logistical issues, but the uprooting of my life undoubtedly created the optimal conditions for a psychological commitment to the goal to take shape.

# Formal Learning with Good Teachers and Assessments

While I credit my success learning Chinese with many of the decisions I made and learning hacks I employed, I can't overlook the gains yielded from having a structured framework to serve as a solid foundation for study. I'm no pedagogical expert, but the progression of material dictated by the teachers and curriculum at my language center was surely more well-thought-out than anything I would have come up with myself if I were endeavouring to rely on self-study completely. This coupled with a range of other elements that come standard with a proper academic learning environment, including qualified instructors, rigorous, daily practice, and self-administered pressure to perform well in front of authority figures on high-stakes tasks, prevented me from bumbling around in fruitless rabbit holes.

# True Immersion

A proper learning environment is one that forces you to use your emerging skills without recourse to familiar crutches. To this end, Taiwan is a society where most people would prefer not to speak English if they can avoid it (as compared to other cosmpolitan hubs in Asia, like Hong Kong or Singapore), and choosing to live there was the obvious first step towards ensuring that my daily interactions involved utterances in Chinese.

However, it is not uncommon to encounter long-term expats in any country with little ability in the local language, as evidence that mere physical presence is insufficient unless you engage with the society around you. Furthermore, the most fruitful contact points with local culture require inserting yourself into pockets of the social fabric where non-native speakers are less likely to tread, but also where a language-agnostic shared interest serves as a medium for facilitating communication across the language barrier. For me, these were the symphonic band and symphony orchestra at the university where I studied. My familiarity with music theory, rehearsal protocol, and general musicianship situated my mind in a context that primed it to infer the meaning of words and phrases I had never heard before.

# Producing Things (and Getting It Wrong)

A practical approach that I often take to learning involves figuring out what I can do make things sticky. While this does technically include memorization as a strategy, making things sticky is principally about building muscle memory for ideas, structures, and patterns. It's about building up the neural pathways in your brain to identify those patterns across new, slightly varied scenarios, and a reliable way to do this is to **engage and stress the brain's productive faculties**. You have to produce a response to a query, at the very least in your head, but preferably out loud or on paper. [reference science] By contrast, exposing the receptive faculties to knowledge through mere reading and listening, even repeatedly, is usually way less effective; this simple insight was clearly lost on my high school self, who thought that reading a chapter over and over again would be an effective way to prepare for the test.

To reiterate a crucial point though: the productive faculties have to be *stressed*. The task presented to the brain has to meet a certain degree of difficulty. It's hard to pin down exactly what that difficulty is, but your typical vocab flashcards won't cut it. Rote memorization of word definitions is simply an exercise in building neural pathways at too small a scale. The right scale involves drawing connections between multiple concepts, or understanding how to situate the task in one of a number of possible contexts, and doing that in a open-ended format where you have nothing before you but empty space or silence to fill.

Using your productive skills on tasks with a higher degree of difficulty ensures that you will regularly get things wrong, with a magntitude of error ranging from drawing a complete blank to missing a subtle but important distinction. Either way, being wrong is accompanied by a conscious recognition of the delta between your brain's output and the right answer. I can only attest to this from personal observation, but this subjective experience of being wrong is extremely important for strengthening those neural pathways. Perhaps it's a way to simultaneously build up inhibitory control over the incorrect patterns of activation, or maybe the emotional affect triggered by being wrong facilitates memory formation; whatever the case, being shown the error of your ways is winning.

# Spaced Repetition

# Some Social Friction

- Having to interrupt conversations all the time to make new flashcards
- A sort of repugnant realization: it may become evident to you and your interlocuter that your relationship exists purely or at least primarily for the benefit of your language advancement
- Insisting on Chinese, no matter what
- Avoiding social situations with lots of expats

# How Much Do You Want It?

Reflecting on these hacks and learning strategies, they share a requisite element of difficulty, inconvenience, or discomfort. The truth is that effective learning requires some minimal amount of suffering. What makes this suffering tolerable? [transition]

Ultimately, how much progress you make in a given period of time will depend on how desperately you want to get better. The process of learning a language has moments that feel like milestones, where some boundary has been crossed and you experience the subjective sensation of meaning automatically lighting up in your brain or of effortless speech production. With serious study, these moments come often, but they are never wholly satisfying.
