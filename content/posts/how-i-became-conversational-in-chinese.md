Learning Chinese could be the one thing in my adult life that has effected the greatest influence on the path I took?

The first thing to say about what it takes to learn a new skill effectively is that it takes **hunger**. You could even say passion, hunger, and the burning desire to acquire new abilities is really all you need to achieve your learning goals, but that would be uninteresting. In fact, there is quite a bit to say about the phenomena that stem from this hunger: hunger-fueled learning hatches new knowledge-acquisition and muscle-strengthening behaviors, frequently borne of compulsive desperation, that do not manifest in typical learning pathways.

# The Grand Gesture

To study Chinese, I made the decision to leave my job and put my career on pause so that I could move to Taiwan and enroll in a formal, university-run language program. At the time, I was 30, with roughly 8 years of experience behind me as a software engineer. With a year and a half of formal study and some months bookending my time abroad to move and get settled, it would be a full two years before I would start working again.

I later came to understand that this hiatus was not without its costs, both to my career and my personal life. On the career side, being completely absent from the tech industry for two years amounted to [falling out of touch with the scene]. In my personal life, friendships waned as people with whom I regularly shared experiences were suddenly separated by an ocean and several timezones. They went on about their lives, as did I.

However, these costs were not entirely unforeseeable, and I had mentally flagged a few of them before I left for Taiwan.

All of this to say that the decision I made about *how* to learn Chinese came with a significant investment in all areas of my life. Conceptually, I liken it to the concept of The Grand Gesture that Cal Newport writes about in *Deep Work*. My recollection of my mental state at that time is hazy, and the physical move to Asia afforded all sorts of logistical issues, but surely the uprooting of my life created space for a psychological commitment to the goal to take shape.

# Formal Learning with Good Teachers and Assessments

# True Immersion

"Fuck you, expats."

# Spaced Repetition

# Some Social Friction

- Having to interrupt conversations all the time to make new flashcards
- A sort of repugnant realization: it may become evident to you and your interlocuter that your relationship exists purely or at least primarily for the benefit of your language advancement

Ultimately, how much progress you make in a given period of time will depend on how much
